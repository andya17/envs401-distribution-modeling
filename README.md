Modeling future distribution of 17 small mammal or mesocarnivore species for a project in the Middlebury College course ENVS 401: Community-Engaged Practicum.

I attempt to follow the [tutorial](https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/011-species-distribution-models.html) for this subject created by Jeff Oliver.
